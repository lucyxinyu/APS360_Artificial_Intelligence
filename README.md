# APS360 Artificial Intelligence Project: Music Transcription


Music transcription is the process of taking an audio representation of a musical piece and creating the corresponding notated score. However, music transcription is a tedious process taking hours of work, and can only be done effectively by those with extensive training. There are many benefits to manually doing music transcription; however, currently the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.

First, transcription can help make music more accessible, as scores can be expensive or unavailable. Students and amateur musicians may not be able to play pieces for fun because they cannot access the sheet music nor do they have the means to do a transcription. Second, many moments of musical brilliance are displayed in improvisational performances, which can be valuable for study. However, due to their improvisational nature, only transcription can turn these performances into sheet music. Third, transcription can be a valuable tool in catching mistakes in large, non-professional ensembles, which may be very difficult for conductors.

Automatic music transcription would help accomplish all the aforementioned benefits minus the drawbacks. However, because of the complexity of music, an algorithmic way of processing audio recordings into a score is difficult to achieve. Thus, we believe that machine learning is the best approach to tackle such a problem because of its advantage in dealing with complex data.

Thus, our goal is to create a deep learning model that can take in an audio recording of classical music and provide an automatic transcription of the music. We split up the project into two milestones: milestone 1 deals with instrument identification while milestone 2 deals with note identification.
